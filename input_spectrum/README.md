BC learning for sounds for PyTorch
============================
This is [Between-class Examples for Deep Sound Recognition](https://github.com/mil-tokyo/bc_learning_sound) for PyTorch.

Implementation of [Learning from Between-class Examples for Deep Sound Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10282) by Yuji Tokozume, Yoshitaka Ushiku, and Tatsuya Harada (ICLR 2018).

This also contains training of EnvNet: [Learning Environmental Sounds with End-to-end Convolutional Neural Network](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7952651/) (Yuji Tokozume and Tatsuya Harada, ICASSP 2017).<sup>[1](#1)</sup>

Some codes in this repo are taken from [Between-class Examples for Deep Sound Recognition](https://github.com/mil-tokyo/bc_learning_sound) and [BC leraning for sounds pytoch Port](https://github.com/RerRayne/bc_learning_pytorch).
## Contents

- Between-class (BC) learning
	- Between-class examples is generated by mixing two training examples belonging to different classes with a random ratio.
	- The mixed data is inputted to the model and the model is trained, outputting the mixing ratio.
- Training of EnvNet and EnvNet2 on ESC-50, ESC-10 [[1]](#1), and UrbanSound8K [[2]](#2) datasets

## Setup
- Install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).
- Prepare datasets following [this page](https://github.com/MKaname/bc_learning_sound_pytorch/tree/master/dataset_gen).
- Python 3.6.9
- Cuda Version 10.1 or 10.2


## Training
- Template:

		python3 main.py --dataset [esc50, esc10, or urbansound8k] --netType [EnvNet or EnvNet2] --data path/to/dataset/directory/  --save path/to/result/ (--BC) (--strongAugment)

- Notes:
	- Please check [opts.py](https://github.com/rerayne/bc_learning_pytorch/blob/master/opts.py) for other command line arguments.
